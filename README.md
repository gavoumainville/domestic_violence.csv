The Rate of Domestic Violence in New York City

This analysis aims to study the correlation between factors surrounding domestic violence in NYC. It looks at the Borough, Victim’s Age and sex, Suspect’s Age and sex. We would also see that in most cases the victim had an intimate relationship with the perpetrator. This data analysis is being limited by missing data in poverty, income level, and unemployment. For this analysis, data used is from 2021 which does not present the most recent data and follow-up reports/analysis would be advised. I was hoping to see if people living in poverty or unemployed are more prone to being abused than people with a higher income that have busy lives going to work. It is my hope that the findings of this topic will aid policy makers, service providers and in understanding the prevalence and impact of domestic violence in New York City.I also hope that this analysis would point researchers in the right direction for further study.
